# solving_geeksforgeeks

👩‍💻 A collection of GeeksforGeeks problems I’m solving — organized, explained, and pushed regularly.

This repo is where I track my progress, write clean code, and sometimes add my thought process for selected problems. Most problems are solved in **Python**.

### 🧠 Why this repo?
To stay consistent with problem-solving, improve my coding skills, and prepare for technical interviews. Also, because GeeksforGeeks = endless practice 💪

### 🚀 How I Solve

> "Read. Understand. Break it down. Code. Refactor. Explain."

For some questions, I also add short GitHub-style explanations describing my approach in plain English — especially for the trickier ones.
